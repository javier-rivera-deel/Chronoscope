# Chronoscope
Final project to obtain Software Engineer's degree. 


Chronoscope (Orig. name in spanish "Cronoscopio") is a web app for managing software projects under agile methodologies. While written in Javascript, takes advantage of the Parse.com API to provide a backend, doing all operations on client side.

The front end is built under Bootstrap 3, taking responsive design and mobile first policies into consideration. 

Chronoscope takes a mixture of agile methodologies, by permitting the creation of teams (5 people max) with a lead that takes the responsability of assining tasks to be completed under sprints. Tasks are visualized in linear order, to all members of teams.
